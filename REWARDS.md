# Reward programs

## Program status update
### February 14th, 2024
Bug bounty program is **LIVE** as of February 14th, 2024. If you would like to participate, please make sure to check out [reported issues in stakewars-iv repository with reward-program-bug-bounty label](https://github.com/near/stakewars-iv/issues) and [reported issues with stateless-validation label](https://github.com/near/nearcore/labels/A-stateless-validation) in nearcore repository to avoid duplicate reporting.

## 1. Overview

The Stake Wars IV reward programs are designed to incentivize external participants to collaborate with the Near Protocol team to find potential issues and bugs in the new sharding implementation - the Stateless Validation. We invite everyone to participate and help make the Near Protocol better and safer. 

There are three major ways to participate in the reward programs:

### 1.1 Bug/issue report (Available for Stage 1 & 2)

A participant can study stateless validation code or play with StatelessNet to identify failure points and submit a bug/issue report. The report should contain enough details about the issue and reproduction steps. The submitted report will be assessed and, if valid, the reporter will be rewarded. The reward amount can vary depending on criticality of the uncovered issue and completeness of the report.

Anyone can participate for this reward.

### 1.2 Traffic generation (Available for Stage 2)

A participant can generate a meaningful amount of traffic on StatelessNet to stress-test the network and claim rewards.
The goal of the program is to understand the capacity of Stateless validation under unexpected traffic in the network.
The reward amount will be determined by traffic size and novelty/uniqueness of traffic patterns.
For efficient monitoring during traffic generation, each proposal needs to be aligned with the engineering team before execution.

Anyone who filled in the [Traffic Generation Proposal](https://github.com/near/stakewars-iv/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&projects=&template=traffic-generation-proposal.md&title=) can participate for this reward.

### 1.3 Running a validator node with high uptime (Available for Stage 2)

In Stage 2 of the program, participants who run a validator node with high uptime can be rewarded in NEAR tokens.
For this reward, only mainnet validators active as of March 1st 2024 are eligible.
Also, it's required to fill in [Becoming a Validator Proposal](https://github.com/near/stakewars-iv/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&projects=&template=becoming-a-validator-proposal.md&title=), and [the validator form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScmgfOdsxV7c5u4fArn79JBf2MBwFqPIqCVU1x0lAYaZoYuxg/viewform).
Details around the uptime threshold and how it is measured will be published in the last week of February 2024. 

## 2. Bug bounty

### 2.1 Overview

While the engineering team is doing their best to make a secure and reliable product, we are all human and things can be overlooked. On mainnet, a bug bounty program has helped identify critical bugs. Having a similar bug bounty program on StatelessNet can reveal issues we are not able to find ourselves. 

### 2.2 Duration

The bug bounty program will start *approximately 2 weeks (Exact date will be updated here)* after the Stake Wars IV launch and it will last throughout the entire duration of Stake Wars IV.

### 2.3 Participation guideline

* A participant can study stateless validation code, join the Stake Wars IV network or interact with it to identify failure points and submit bug reports in the stakewars-iv repo using [the provided template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug-report.md);
* A report should be made on [the current GitHub repository](https://github.com/near/stakewars-iv/issues/new). Only the first reporter of a new issue with a valid report will be rewarded.

### 2.4 Reward assessment criteria
* Criticality:
  * P0: Must be fixed before mainnet launch due its impact if exploited. (e.g. can result in monetary damage of others or token minting out of thin air)
  * P1: Not required for the initial launch but should be a blocker for future iterations as it can hinder reliability/scalability (e.g. can cause the chain stall or involuntary validator kickout)
  * P2: Not likely to cause a major issue in the near future but good to have (e.g. short term slow down of block processing time)
  * N/A: Not an issue / Wishlist
* Report completeness
  * High: The report contains the exact code pointers and suggested fix that can be a long term solution
  * Medium: The report contains the exact code pointers and suggested fix that works but either with compromises or is a short term solution
  * Low: The report contains code pointers but the fix is incorrect or cannot be implemented

### 2.5 Multiplier (TBD)
* Criticality
  * P0: 2x
  * P1: 1x
  * P2: 0.75x
  * N/A: 0
* Report completeness
  * High: 1.5x
  * Medium: 1.2x
  * Low: 1x
 
### 2.6 Reward amount
* Baseline reward amount: **150 NEAR**
* Possible reward range: **0 NEAR - 450 NEAR**, depending on quality of a report

### 2.7 Reward calculation example
* Report with exact code pointers and long term solution on the issue with P0 criticality
  * N * 2 * 1.5 = 3N
* Report with code pointers and short term fix on the issue with P1 criticality
  * N * 1 * 1.2 = 1.2N

## 3. Traffic generation

### 3.1 Overview

Since the mainnet launch, Protocol engineering team has experienced multiple events where unprecedented traffic patterns resulted in different outcomes the team could not think of. Based on such experience, the team concluded that stress testing the network with various traffics can reveal its weakness and things to improve.

On the StatelessNet, a participant can support the effort by generating a creative traffic at large volume that can push various parts of protocol infrastructure to their limits. 

### 3.2 Duration

Stage 2 of stateless validation StatelessNet. 

### 3.3 Participation guideline

* A participant must submit a traffic generation proposal and coordinate with the Protocol engineering team to start the test. While this adds additional burden, this is to make sure that each stress test is properly monitored and does not interfere with one another.
* A proposal should be submitted on [the current GitHub repository](https://github.com/near/stakewars-iv/issues/new) and will be reviewed in order.
* All the participants should follow [the provided template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/traffic-generation-proposal.md);
* Generated traffic should be notable and original in at least one aspect to be considered eligible for a reward
  * [Note] Detailed TBD on whatâ€™s invalid needs to be shared upfront, e.g. Repetitive FT transfer

### 3.4 Reward assessment criteria
* Volume (TBD)
  * High: Involves considerable amount of user accounts and/or produces X txn requests/sec
  * Med: Involves reasonable amount of user accounts and/or produces Y txn requests/sec
* Novelty of traffic pattern
  * High: the traffic pattern the protocol engineering team could not think of before
  * Med: the traffic pattern the protocol engineering team discussed in the past, but never tried before
  * Low: the traffic pattern the protocol engineering team tested in the past
* Outcome
  * Success: traffic was successfully generated.
  * Failure: test was failed to be conducted for various reasons (participant unavailability, bug in script, etc)

### 3.5 Multiplier
* Volume:
  * High: 1.5x
  * Med: 1x
* Novelty:
  * High: 1.5x
  * Med: 1x
  * Low: 0.75x
* Outcome:
  * Success: 1x
  * Failure: 0.2x
 
### 3.6 Reward amount
* Baseline reward amount: **500 NEAR**
* Possible reward range: **0 NEAR - 1,125 NEAR**, depending on volume, novelty and outcome of traffic generation attempt.

### 3.7 Reward calculation example
* High volume test with medium novelty of traffic pattern -> test success
  * N * 1.5 * 1 * 1 = 1.5N
* Medium volume test with medium novelty of traffic pattern -> test failure
  * N * 1 * 1 * 0.2 = 0.2N

## 4. Additional reward for top N participants
The top five participants, based on a number of valid reports and proposals, will get **300 NEAR** as a reward for their active participation.

## 5. Running a node with high uptime (Available for Stage 2)

In Stage 2 of the program, participants who run a validator node with high uptime can be rewarded in NEAR tokens. The details for this reward are the following:
* Reward amount: up to 150 NEAR tokens per reward
* Number of rewards: 100, based on a first come first served approach: we will offer the rewards in order of the form submissions, to the participants that meet the criteria
* Eligibility criteria:
  * Be in the active validator set on mainnet on March 1st 2024 14:00 UTC
  * We will reward one StatelessNet node per mainnet validator pool ID.
  * Run a node in StatelessNet in March 2024
  * Have an uptime on StatelessNet of >80%. The uptime is calculated as follows: as average of all epoch uptimes, with uptimes as reported by near-cli, on a timeframe from the moment the node joined the active validator set (or March 1st 2024 14:00 UTC, whichever is last) to March 31st 2024
  * The size of the reward is scaled to the actual start date of running a node, with 150 NEAR if the node is run starting March 1st 2024. E.g., if a node is run between March 15th - March 31st, then the reward would be 75 NEAR
* The rewards will be transferred to the owner of the mainnet validator pool ID used when the Validator Request Form was filled in

Note: we encourage participants to join the reward program as close to March 1st as they can, to increase the chance of getting into the set of 100 rewards and to be eligible for the full size of the reward.
